# The CLI registry

Every run mode Codeman can launch — Claude Code, Terminal/Shell, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Pi, Grok, DeepSeek Harness, OMP and GitHub Copilot CLI — is a `CliEntry`: a data record describing how to find the binary, how to build its command line, what environment it needs, and what it can do. Code that used to ask "which CLI is this?" asks the entry instead.

## Where it lives

| File | What it holds |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `types.ts` | The `CliEntry` interface and everything under it. Read this first. |
| `stock.ts` | The shipped catalog. **The only file allowed to name a CLI id.** |
| `schema.ts` | Zod validation, including the cross-field checks that reject an incoherent entry at LOAD time. |
| `argv.ts` | The argv engine: the only code that turns typed tokens into a command string. |
| `patterns.ts` | The NAMED value patterns (`model`, `uuid`, `path-segment`, …) and the regex-compilation guard. |
| `profiles.ts` | The names of behaviours that genuinely need code, kept import-free so `schema.ts` can validate one. |
| `registry.ts` | Loading, merging `~/.codeman/clis.json`, and the accessors (`getCli`, `enabledClis`). |

`src/session-cli-registry-bridge.ts` maps the legacy per-mode option bag onto the engine, and `src/utils/cli-resolver.ts` / `src/utils/cli-launcher.ts` do registry-driven binary resolution and launcher-profile dispatch.

## The override file

`~/.codeman/clis.json` (instance-scoped through `dataPath()`) holds overrides and custom entries only, never a copy of the stock catalog: `{ "clis": { "<id>": { ...partial entry... } } }`. Objects merge key-wise onto the stock entry, arrays replace wholesale. **The file must be mode 0600**; the loader refuses any group/world permission bit, read bits included, so a file created with a normal umask (0644) is ignored until you `chmod 600` it. Every reason a file was ignored or an entry dropped is logged once, prefixed `[cli-registry]`, on the first load. A stock entry whose override fails validation falls back to the shipped definition; a custom entry that fails is dropped. The file is read once per process and re-read after a change made through CLI management (below).

## Managing CLIs from Settings

App Settings → Agents & CLIs → **CLI management** (`cliManagementEnabled`, default OFF; admin-only in multi-user mode) lists every entry with an installed/not-installed badge and:

- toggles any entry on or off. A `kind: 'shell'` entry cannot be disabled, and the row shows no switch for it. A disabled CLI disappears from the Run menu, the welcome screen and the phone overview, and new session requests for it are rejected.
- installs a missing **stock** CLI by running its shipped install command, after a confirm that names the exact command. Only one install per CLI runs at a time, and the command runs without any `CODEMAN_*` variable in its environment. An `npm install -g` command is pointed at `~/.local` (which every resolver searches) when the npm global prefix is not writable by the server user, for example a system node under `/usr`; a writable prefix, a prefix that does not exist yet but could be created, and an explicit `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` are left alone. A custom entry's install command is never executed.
- adds, edits and deletes **custom** entries (id, label, badge, binaries, launch argv). The server re-validates the whole assembled entry through `CliEntrySchema`, so the form cannot bypass the load-time rules.

These are the only writes to `clis.json`. They are serialized, and a file that does not parse or has unsafe permissions is refused rather than overwritten; fix it (or `chmod 600` it) and retry. The HTTP routes are listed in `docs/api-reference.md` under *CLI management*.

## The shape of an entry

```ts
interface CliEntry {
  id: CliId; // 'codex'
  label: string; // 'Codex' — shown in menus
  shortBadge: string; // short label ("Run CX", the Settings CLI list), e.g. 'CX'; tabs show the run-mode-dot logo instead (no mark at all with CLI Logos on Tabs off)
  accent: string; // single hex colour
  enabled: boolean;
  stock: boolean; // set by the loader; a custom entry can never claim it
  order: number;
  kind: 'agent' | 'shell';
  discovery: CliDiscovery; // how to find and prove the binary
  launch: CliLaunch; // the structured argv template
  env: CliEnv; // exports, tmux setenv keys, the env-override allowlist
  capabilities: CliCapabilities; // what every call site reads instead of the id
  //   .workDetect?: { promptGlyph, workingLine, watchingLine?, watchingLines?, awaitingLine? }
  //   — how this CLI's pane shows work, work it started in the background, and a turn
  //   that ended waiting for workers it will resume from
  //   .modelDetect?: { screenLine, screenLines? }
  //   (where this CLI's own chrome names the model it runs: SessionState.displayModel)
  //   .launchDefaults?: { [launchParam]: settingsKey }
  //   (synced App Settings that seed a LOCAL launch's params the caller left unset;
  //   codex's model and reasoning effort, via src/web/launch-defaults.ts)
  overlays: CliOverlays; // remote-SSH / Docker pane commands, credential store
}
```

`capabilities` is the important part. It is what `isExternalCliMode()`, `isAltScreenStripMode()`, `hooksAvailableForMode()` and every other former per-mode branch actually read.

### Regexes that come from config

Five capability fields carry a regular expression an override file can set: `discovery.version.regex`, `capabilities.workDetect.workingLine`, `capabilities.workDetect.watchingLine`, `capabilities.workDetect.awaitingLine` and `capabilities.modelDetect.screenLine`. All five go through `compileVersionRegex()`, which caps the source at 200 characters, refuses the nested-quantifier shapes that cause catastrophic backtracking, and returns `null` rather than throwing so every caller degrades instead of crashing.

`workingLine` is the one that matters most, because it is compiled once per session and then run against every accumulated PTY chunk and every pane capture. A nested quantifier there is a ReDoS against the event loop for the whole server, not just that session. The guard therefore runs in two places, and neither is redundant: `schema.ts` rejects the entry at LOAD time so a bad pattern never reaches a session, and `_workingLinePattern()` in `session.ts` compiles through the same helper so the runtime cannot end up with a pattern the schema would have refused.

`modelDetect.screenLine` names the model a session runs, for the tile grid's and the split pane's headers (`SessionState.displayModel`). It must have exactly ONE capture group, the model, which `schema.ts` checks at LOAD time, and it runs over the last `screenLines` (1 to 8, default 1) non-blank rows of the capture the idle/working probe already takes, joined with newlines so a pattern can anchor on the row above. Like `watchingLine`, the rows are pane text the agent writes most of, so a pattern must anchor on chrome only that CLI draws. The two stock ones, measured on live panes: dsh-TUI's status line on the row under its composer's rounded border (`╰─+╯\n ?(<model>)`, three rows), codex's `  <model> <effort> · ` footer (its last row, or the row above codex 0.162's indented hint row, so a two-row window), and opencode's composer agent row (`┃  Build  <model> <provider>`, directly above the box's `╹` edge, eight rows because its home screen puts up to five rows of its own chrome below it). opencode's field is the model AND the provider, since only colour separates them on that row; the pattern takes the LAST such row in the window, so a composer-shaped row the agent prints higher up cannot stand in for it. A screen that does not match keeps the last model the session reported; a CLI without the field shows its launch model, if any. Claude needs none: its statusLine exporter reports `model.display_name` on every render. ⚠️ dsh-TUI's first field is the model only while its status bar's model field is on; switched off, it is the next field: the reasoning effort (` medium · <cwd>`), the session mode, or the folder name. So a captured field is not taken when it is one of the CLI's declared `modelDetect.rejectWords` (single tokens, compared ignoring case; dsh lists every effort id its adapters offer and the shipped mode ids) or the session's own working-directory basename (the shared reader's rule, for every CLI). Anything else the pattern captures is the model, so the official `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` ids are read.

`modelDetect.configResolver` names a READER in `src/model-config-resolvers.ts` (a name, never code in config, like a launcher profile) that resolves the model the CLI's own config pins for one session, for while its screen names none (the `config` source of `displayModel`, ranked below any report from the running CLI). It runs at every pane start, attach and relaunch, with the session's own launch config and env, and must be read-only, bounded (probe before read, no synchronous filesystem call) and return the model id alone. The one stock reader, `deepseek-route` (`src/deepseek-route-config.ts`), resolves dsh-TUI's route the way dsh composes it for the session's profile under the session's `DSH_HOME`: the last of `profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml` and `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml` carrying `config` for the `dsh-tui` row counts, and only when it names both `provider` and `model`. Anything in doubt answers nothing: a half-pinned route, a profile without dsh-TUI, an unreadable, oversized or symlinked-out layer, a file beyond its narrow YAML subset.

`watchingLine` reads a different row of the same screen. A CLI draws it while work the agent
itself started is still running — Claude prints `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on · 1 monitor · ← for
agents` while a monitor, a backgrounded shell or a cloud session is live. Codeman turns that
into `Session.watching`, and an idle prompt from such a session opens already acknowledged,
so a pane waiting for its own background work never raises an alert a human cannot answer.
Group 1 is the label, and a CLI that declares no pattern reports no background work.
Claude's Artifact comment monitor is the one chip that does not count. It waits for a human
to comment on a page the agent published, so Claude's pattern refuses any footer that
carries it, and the idle alert goes out as usual.

Two CLIs declare such a row today, and they put it in different places. Claude writes its
chip on the last row of the screen, so it keeps the default one-row window and anchors on
the `·` its footer joins items with. Codex pins
`1 background terminal running · /ps to view · /stop to close` ABOVE its composer, which
puts the row third from the bottom once the status line and the composer are counted, and
fourth on codex 0.162+ at rest, where a `← for agents · ? for shortcuts` hint row sits under
the status line (it disappears while a prompt is typed). So its entry declares
`watchingLines: 4` and matches that row end to end. Both were measured against live panes
rather than read out of a binary, which is the standard for adding a third.

`awaitingLine` covers the quiet pane that is neither idle nor watching: a turn that ENDED
to wait for workers the CLI will resume from by itself. When background agents or an
ultracode workflow are still running at turn end, Claude closes the turn with
`✻ Waiting for 1 dynamic workflow to finish` instead of `✻ Brewed for 1m 18s`, and a pane
showing that row counts as working. ⚠️ Claude renders the row once and never redraws it, so
the words are still on screen after the workers report back and the follow-up turn ends.
The pattern is therefore never run over the whole pane: `isAwaitingWorkers()`
(`session-activity.ts`) walks up from the composer past blank, framed and indented rows and
tests only the first row that starts in column 0, which is the newest transcript row. Claude
starts its own rows in column 0 and the agent's prose never does, so the anchor also keeps an
agent from holding its own session busy.

That label is the one value in the registry that an AGENT can influence, because it comes off
the agent's own screen. Two things keep it honest, and both belong to whoever adds a pattern
for a new CLI. `watchingLabel()` in `session-activity.ts` searches only the last few
non-blank rows, which should be the part of the screen the CLI draws rather than the agent,
and the pattern should anchor on chrome only that CLI can produce. Keep the window as small
as the layout allows, since every row it adds is another row the agent may be able to write.
The label is also ANSI-stripped and length-capped at the source, and every interpolation of
it into markup goes through `escapeHtml()`, since it ends up on a badge and in an approval
card.

The two shipped entries do not sit equally well behind that rule, and the difference decides
what a pattern is allowed to do. Claude's chip is the last row, so its one-row window holds
nothing the agent can write — not even the status line above it, whose command a session
running with permissions bypassed can write into its own `.claude/settings.json`. Codex's row
shares its slot with the last row of the transcript whenever no terminal is running, so a
message ending in that exact line is matched. What keeps that harmless is `hooks: 'none'`: no
hook event from a codex session reaches the approvals inbox, so a forged label costs a wrong
badge and cannot silence an alert. Before giving a CLI both hook signals and a pattern, make
sure its row is one the agent cannot write.

### Three capabilities that must stay independent

`external`, `hooks` and `altScreen` describe three different, deliberately unequal sets, and deriving any one from another has already shipped a bug. `shell` has no hooks but is **not** an external CLI, so a hooks predicate written as `!isExternalCliMode()` accepted `until=stop` on a shell session and then blocked the caller for their entire timeout. `deepseek` is the mirror image: it IS external and it DOES have hooks.

`test/cli-capability-predicates.test.ts` asserts that no two of the three are equivalent across the catalog, so collapsing them fails the build rather than a user's session.

## The newline chord

`capabilities.newline` (`'line-feed'` | `'esc-enter'`, absent = line feed) is the byte sequence the `send-key` route types into the pane for Shift+Enter. A line feed (`0x0a`, also Ctrl+Enter) is what Claude Code's Ink input reads as "insert a newline"; `esc-enter` (`ESC CR`, the Option/Alt+Enter chord) is there for a composer that ignores a bare line feed. No stock CLI declares it today: the bytes are typed by tmux on the server, so the browser's OS cannot change what a CLI reads, and Codex 0.147.0 was checked to take a line feed (a Shift+Enter that submits is the keypress leak fixed in #520, not a byte problem). A user `clis.json` can set it for a CLI that needs it. It is an enum rather than a byte string on purpose: config never carries bytes that get typed into a pane. Settings → Terminal & Input → **Key tester** prints what a browser reports for keydown/keypress/keyup, to see whether a device is sending what you think.

## Arg-template safety

The composed command line is interpolated into `bash -c "…"` inside tmux, which makes command construction a security boundary. Four independent layers keep config out of it:

1. **Config contains no shell text.** There is no `command: "..."` field anywhere in the schema. An entry declares a sequence of typed tokens; `argv.ts` is the only place that turns them into a string, and it owns every separator itself — one space between tokens, ` || ` between fallback variants. Neither can originate from config, because config has no field that could hold either.
2. **Every literal is validated at LOAD time** against a safe-word pattern (no space, quote, backtick, `$`, `;`, `&`, `|`, redirection, parens, braces, newline or backslash). A bad literal **rejects the whole entry** rather than being dropped, because a silently dropped flag would change security-relevant behaviour — losing `--no-approve` is not a cosmetic difference.
3. **Values resolve through NAMED patterns.** A value placeholder selects a `TokenPattern` (`model`, `uuid`, `slug`, `path-segment`, `tool-list`, …) from `patterns.ts`; config can never supply its own regex for a value, so a `clis.json` structurally cannot widen its own validation. A value that fails its pattern drops the whole argument, exactly as the hand-written builders did: an invalid `--model` omits `--model`, it never substitutes something else.
4. **Escaping is independent of validation.** `renderToken()` re-checks the resolved value before emitting it unquoted, and single-quotes anything else — so even a value that somehow bypassed validation is quoted, never concatenated raw.

The only config-supplied regexes are `discovery.version.regex` and `discovery.identity.regex`. Both run against **command output** rather than a shell token, both are compiled through `compileVersionRegex()` (length cap, nested-quantifier rejection, never the `g` flag), and the output they see is truncated first.

## Named profiles: the escape hatch

Some differences genuinely need to run code rather than be described. Those are **named profiles**: a capability field holds a profile NAME, and the implementation lives in one place keyed by that name — never by CLI id.

- `discovery.launcherProfile` — for a CLI whose binary is not the agent. `dsh` boots `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>`, so "installed" and "runnable" have different answers; the profile answers both, plus why a specifically-named target will not work. Implemented in `utils/cli-launcher.ts`.
- `env.setenvProfile` — per-CLI environment setup that is more than a list of keys, such as DeepSeek's status bridge.
- `capabilities.transcript` — which on-disk history reader understands this CLI (`claude-jsonl`, `codex-rollout`, `deepseek-zstd`, `omp-jsonl`, `none`).
- `capabilities.echo.predictProfile` — the predictive-echo model a composer needs.

The names live in `profiles.ts`, which is kept free of imports so `schema.ts` can validate a name at load time. A profile this build does not implement is a load-time error naming the field, rather than a CLI that silently looks permanently uninstalled.

## DeepSeek: the four assumptions it breaks

DeepSeek is worth reading before assuming an entry looks like its siblings — the schema carries four extensions because of it.

| What it breaks | How the registry expresses it |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dsh` is a profile LAUNCHER, not the agent, so "installed" is not "runnable". | `discovery.launcherProfile` + `discovery.launcherTargetParam`. |
| Its permission switch is the **`DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` env var**, not a flag — the harness has none. | `env.configSetenv` (so the ordinary `privilegedParams` clamp still reaches it) **and** `capabilities.privilegedEnvKeys`. |
| It is the only non-claude mode with real hook signals, and for it that is a per-SESSION question. | `capabilities.hooks: 'supervised'` — a third state, not a boolean. |
| Its transcript is zstd session files, one frame per write. | `capabilities.transcript: 'deepseek-zstd'`. |

## Identity probes

`discovery.identity` asks the binary whether it is the program we meant, and it runs **before** the version probe, because a version probe cannot tell an impostor from the real thing. Debian ships an unrelated `dsh` (dancer's shell) that answers `--version` perfectly happily, and npm carries squatters for both `pi` and `grok`.

`discovery.version.requireVersionMatch` is the weaker companion: a binary whose version output has the wrong shape counts as ABSENT rather than present-with-unknown-version. That is what a short, generic binary name needs, and it is what keeps `codeman doctor` and the run mode from telling the user opposite things about the same binary — both read the same regex off the same entry.

## The no-id-branching rule

`test/cli-registry-no-id-branching.test.ts` fails the build if a CLI id comparison appears outside the stock catalog. It builds its id list from the live catalog, blanks comment lines before scanning (comments legitimately quote the pattern to explain why a branch was removed, and blanking rather than dropping is what keeps reported line numbers pointing at the real file), and keeps an allowlist in which **every entry carries its reason**.

It matches four shapes, not one: `mode === '<id>'`, `mode !== '<id>'`, `case '<id>':`, and `['<id>', …].includes(mode)`. The first version matched `===` only, and that gap was not academic — the refactor it guards converted the `===` sites and left the negated ones, so 36 `!==` branches survived it, including a seven-mode chain auto-enabling Ralph under a comment asking the next person to keep it in step with a predicate by hand while the sibling code path already read the capability. A guard that sees half the shapes reports a count measured over the half it happens to catch.

The allowlist is not a formality. If a branch is about what a CLI can DO it belongs in `CliCapabilities`; the entries that remain are things that are not CLI-behaviour branches at all — chiefly the legacy per-mode `<Mode>Config` objects on `POST /api/sessions`, which are a fact about the public HTTP API rather than about any CLI, plus a few documented cases where `mode === 'claude'` is genuinely the right question (Read My Mind reads Claude's _own_ transcript, so a capability there would be actively wrong).

`test/frontend-cli-no-id-branching.test.ts` is the same guard for the two frontend files the CLI registry's Run-menu consolidation touches, `session-ui.js` and `mobile-overview.js` — deliberately not the rest of `src/web/public/`, whose per-CLI rules stay out of scope for now (see "Fields declared for later" below). Its allowlist keys on `<file>::<expression>` with no line number, since a single unrelated edit to a contended file would otherwise shift every subsequent line and make every entry go stale at once, and each entry additionally carries the exact number of approved call sites — a bare key would let a brand-new branch reusing an already-approved expression land unreviewed. Its comparison shape differs from the backend guard's in one respect: the left-hand side may be any identifier, not only one named `mode`, `id` or `agentType`, because the review of #458 found `const m = this._runMode; if (m === 'codex')` slipping past the named form while the scanned file already filters with `(m) => m !== 'shell'`.

## Two namespaces called `param`

`launch.params` keys, `env.configSetenv[].fromParam` and `capabilities.privilegedParams[].param` all name a **launch param**. The **legacy wire field** a param arrives as is a separate namespace, and `launch.legacyConfigAliases` is the only bridge between the two.

This matters because it is invisible when it is wrong. `capabilities.privilegedParams[].param` is the multi-user bypass clamp's only handle on a CLI's privilege switch, and a name from the wrong namespace clamps **nothing**: no load error, no failing test, the clamp simply stops running. Codex is the entry where the two names differ (`bypassApprovals` as the param, `dangerouslyBypassApprovals` on the wire), so it is the one that catches a regression. `schema.ts` rejects any entry naming a param it never declared, on both `configSetenv.fromParam` and `privilegedParams.param`.

## Fields declared for later

`accent`, `capabilities.echo`, `capabilities.wheelForward`, `capabilities.keyboardAccessory` and `capabilities.maxFrameBytes` are **declared but not yet read**. (`shortBadge` was on this list until the CLI management list in Settings started showing it.) They all describe frontend behaviour, and the frontend is deliberately untouched here: `app.js`, `terminal-ui.js` and `styles.css` keep their own hand-authored per-CLI rules, and moving them is its own piece of work verified by a browser/mobile suite the CI gate cannot see.

Treat those values as **transcribed, not authoritative** — nothing enforces that `echo.policy` matches `_updateLocalEchoState`'s fallthrough, so re-measure before wiring one up. `accent` is the one exception: it was measured against styles.css on 2026-09-21 (method in the comment above `CLAUDE` in `stock.ts`), though nothing keeps it in step with the CSS either. A field that is both wrong and unread is worse than an absent one, because the next reader trusts it; `test/cli-registry-no-id-branching.test.ts` pins the list so it cannot quietly grow, and wiring one up makes its line there fail, which is the direction you want.

`overlays.credStore` is in the same category, for a sharper reason: the Docker credential-seeding path still reads its own `CRED_STORES` table, because this shape allows ONE store per CLI and the live table needs two for gemini (`.gemini` for the CLI's own auth plus `.config/gcloud` for Vertex), while deepseek declares none here even though `.dsh` is seeded. Wiring it means making the field an array and correcting those two entries — a change to credential seeding, which is simultaneously the worst thing here to get wrong and the least covered by tests, since every docker IO path is no-op'd under vitest.

Everything else in the interface is live, including `overlays.remote` / `overlays.docker`, which back `defaultRemoteCommandForMode()` and `defaultDockerCommandForMode()` directly. Those two used to be hardcoded `Record<…CommandMode, string>` tables duplicating the registry with nothing keeping the two in step; `test/location-overlay-commands.test.ts` pins every resulting command as a literal string.

## Consumers outside the server

Two things need the catalogue but cannot import TypeScript, so `npm run generate:cli-catalog`
(`scripts/generate-cli-catalog.mts`) emits two artifacts from `stock.ts`. Both are committed,
and `test/cli-catalog-sync.test.ts` fails if either drifts from a fresh generation.

| Artifact | Consumer | Why it exists |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/clis.stock.json` | `scripts/lib/cli-catalog.mjs` (Docker build args), tests | A `.mjs` cannot import the registry. |
| a marked block inside `install.sh` | the installer itself | It runs via `curl \| bash` before any checkout exists, so it can read neither. |

Only `id`, `label`, `shortBadge`, `enabled`, `order`, `kind` and `discovery` are exported.
`launch`, `env`, `capabilities` and `overlays` are spawn-time concerns the server alone
interprets, and a test asserts they never leak into the artifact — a second reading of the
launch model in a consumer that cannot be tested against a real spawn is exactly what this
registry exists to prevent.

The install.sh copy is **embedded, not fetched**, and is the FULL catalogue. An earlier design
fetched it and fell back to a hardcoded two-CLI list, which degraded silently on an empty
response; there is no degraded mode to fall into now, and no network fetch either — a `curl |
bash` from master already carries a catalogue exactly as fresh as the script itself, so there is
nothing a refresh would buy that isn't already true. An earlier draft added an opt-in refresh
with a `TRUSTED`/`DISPLAY` array split to keep it from ever writing the executed command; it was
dropped before merge rather than shipped half-verified — the split's only actual write was the
label, `DISPLAY` never diverged from `TRUSTED` in practice, and the added surface (a second
array, a fetch path, three failure shapes to warn on) bought nothing the embedded copy didn't
already have.

### The install-command trust boundary

Three rules, and the middle one is why the embed matters:

1. **The server never executes an entry's `install.command`.** Unchanged, and still enforced by nothing executing it: the field is display text (`CliDiscovery.install.command`).
2. **`install.sh` executes only commands embedded in itself.** Those arrive in the same file, over the same TLS fetch, in the same commit as the `curl \| bash` line that fetched the script — identical trust to the hardcoded vendor one-liners it replaces.
3. **Nothing fetched at install time is ever executed.** There is no second code path that fetches anything after the script itself has been fetched.

That is mechanical rather than a promise. `CLI_INSTALL_CMD_TRUSTED` is written only from the
generated block and is the only array the installer ever runs or displays — there is no second
array a refresh could rewrite, because there is no refresh. `test/cli-catalog-sync.test.ts`
asserts that the embedded commands are exactly the registry's, and
`test/install-sh-invariants.test.ts` that nothing in `install.sh` `eval`s.

### bash 3.2

macOS ships bash 3.2 and the documented install is `curl -fsSL <url> | bash` under
`set -euo pipefail`, so a bash-4 construct is not a warning there — it kills the install. The
generated block therefore uses parallel indexed arrays with **offset/length windows** into one
flat array instead of delimiters (a `$HOME` containing a space needs no `IFS` handling, and an
entry with nothing to contribute gets length 0 and is never iterated). CI runs `bash -n` and
executes the script inside a real `bash:3.2` container, because the empty-window case is a
runtime `set -u` abort that `bash -n` cannot see.

## Resolve at call time, never at import

Anything reading the registry must resolve it when it is asked, not when its module is first imported. `sessionModeSchema()`, `allowedEnvPrefixes()`, `dependencyRegistry()` and each resolver's `searchDirs` thunk all re-read the catalog per call.

A module-level const freezes at first import, and the failure is asymmetric: a CLI enabled while the server is running moved the run menu but not the frozen surface, so validation rejected a mode the menu offered, or `codeman doctor` reported a catalog nobody had any more.

## Adding a CLI

1. Add a `CliEntry` to `stock.ts`.
2. Run `npm run generate:cli-catalog` and commit **both** artifacts (`config/clis.stock.json` and `install.sh`). The installer's detection, its install menu, its reminder text and the Docker agent image all follow from that one step — this is what makes upstream `b6d0f1fa` ("wire OMP into install.sh's CLI detection, it had none") impossible rather than merely fixed.
3. Add a golden spawn-command pin to `test/cli-registry-spawn-golden.test.ts`, a row to `test/cli-capability-predicates.test.ts`, its remote/docker commands to `test/location-overlay-commands.test.ts`, and its search paths to `test/install-sh-detection-parity.test.ts`.
4. Only if it cannot install with a plain `npm install -g <pkg>`: give it a layer in `docker/agent.Dockerfile` and set `discovery.install.agentImageLayer: { kind: 'dedicated', reason }` on its entry in `stock.ts`. `test/docker-agent-image-coverage.test.ts` requires both, so an exclusion cannot quietly become an omission. An entry with no `npmPackage` needs only the Dockerfile layer, since it never enters the shared npm layer in the first place.
5. That is usually all. If you find yourself wanting to add an `if` somewhere, the guard test will tell you — and the answer is a capability field, or a named profile if it genuinely needs to run code.

## MCP server sync

`capabilities.mcpConfig` (`{ path, format, relocation? }`, `path` relative to the home directory) names the file a CLI keeps its user-level MCP server list in and the dialect it is written in. `src/mcp-sync.ts` reads that list from every ENABLED CLI that declares one, and that is installed or already has the file (a CLI that is neither is reported `absent`, never created), and adds any server a CLI is missing from the others. It writes other tools' own config, so it is **opt-in**: `mcpSyncEnabled` (synced, default OFF) gates `GET`/`POST /api/mcp-sync` (403 while off) and the Settings → Agents & CLIs → MCP servers controls. Declared today for claude, gemini, codex, opencode and antigravity (and GitHub Copilot CLI, below); every format was checked against what the CLI's own `mcp add` writes, except opencode's (documented, not installed to check). A CLI with no entry (pi, grok, omp, deepseek) is not guessed at: it is listed as `unsupported` in the result when enabled. Adding one is a registry entry plus a small adapter in `mcp-sync.ts`, and a verified fixture in `test/mcp-sync.test.ts`.

**Tools that are not run modes, or that declare no `mcpConfig`.** `src/mcp-sync-targets.ts` declares such tools as plain data (`MCP_SYNC_ONLY_TOOLS`: id, label, config path, dialect, relocation var, the binary whose presence means "installed"). They join the registry CLIs as sync targets (listed after them, so a registry CLI's definition wins a same-name difference), under the same rules: installed or already configured, otherwise `absent`. GitHub Copilot CLI is both: its registry entry declares `mcpConfig`, so while the run mode is enabled the sync-only row is skipped, and it applies only if the run mode is disabled. Copilot's dialect is `copilot-json` (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, relocated by `COPILOT_HOME`; checked against `copilot mcp add` 1.0.94): `mcpServers`, each entry with `tools` (`["*"]` = all), `type` `local` | `http` | `sse`, `command`/`args`/`env` or `url`/`headers`. `copilot mcp disable` does not mark the entry: it lists the name under `disabledMcpServers` in `settings.json` beside the config. Sync reads that list (never writes it) so a disabled server is not copied, and reports the target `unreadable` if `settings.json` is not valid JSON rather than guessing.

`relocation` (`{ envVar, path }`) names the env var the CLI itself reads to move that file: claude `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (`.claude.json` under it), codex `CODEX_HOME` (`config.toml`), opencode `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (`opencode/opencode.json`), gemini `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` (`.gemini/settings.json`) copilot `COPILOT_HOME` (`mcp-config.json`); antigravity follows `$HOME` only, so it declares none. The var is read from the SERVER process env at call time, which is the env the CLIs Codeman spawns inherit. An absolute value moves the file to `<value>/<relocation.path>`, an empty one counts as unset (as it does for each CLI), and anything else reports the target `skipped` with the reason instead of writing a file the CLI never reads. A per-session relocation (a session's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in `envOverrides`) is not followed: the sync only knows the server's environment.

The rules the module keeps and the tests pin: it only ADDS (a name already defined, in any shape, is never edited or removed; a same-name difference is reported as a conflict); a server switched off in its own CLI is not copied; it never writes a file it could not parse (opencode JSONC with comments, a TOML file with a duplicate table) and re-parses the new text before writing; codex TOML is read with a real parser (`smol-toml`), so CRLF files and inline tables are handled; names such as `__proto__` are ignored and every table keyed by an untrusted name has no prototype; a symlinked config is written through, not replaced; a file that receives `env`/`headers` is left `0600`; only one apply runs at a time; and its result carries server names only, never env values or headers, and never file text: a parse failure is reported by line and column, not by the parser's message (smol-toml prints a code frame of the offending lines and V8's JSON errors quote source, either of which can hold a secret). The schema restricts `path` and `relocation.path` to a relative path without `..`, since sync writes to it.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

`copilot` (npm `@github/copilot`) is a stock entry. A bare launch is `copilot`, in its own Manual Approval mode. The launch parameters follow the grok/omp shape: `model` (`--model`), `resumeId` (`--resume <id>`, an id, id prefix or session name: a single word that starts with a letter or digit, so a flag-shaped value such as `--yolo` is dropped rather than read as its own flag) and `continueSession` (`--continue`, skipped when a resume id is set), plus `allowAll` (`--yolo`: allow every tool, path and URL). The legacy config object is `copilotConfig` (`{ model, allowAll, resumeSessionId, continueSession }`). The Run button sends `allowAll: true` like the other agent CLIs' bypass switches, and `allowAll` is declared in `privilegedParams`, so a non-granted multi-user owner has it forced back to `false` (an absent config is never materialized: a bare spawn is already safe). Session history resume goes through `copilotConfig.resumeSessionId` / `continueSession`. The tab names the model it reads from the footer (`modelDetect`). It declares `mcpConfig` (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, relocated by `COPILOT_HOME`) and no `credStore`: its token sits in `config.json` in plain text on a host without a keyring, so a Docker case is not seeded and you sign in inside the container. `env.allowedKeys` is empty on purpose: a headless host sets `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, which the `COPILOT_` prefix admits, and `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` stay out of the one global allowlist.

Measured on 1.0.94 inside tmux: an alternate-screen TUI with mouse tracking on, whose composer is the `❯` between two rules. While a turn runs the footer reads `◉ Working esc edit prompt` (the dot alternates `◉`/`◎`), which is the `workDetect` working line. Keystrokes sent with `tmux send-keys` reach the composer, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, and a shell tool call completes inside tmux; github/copilot-cli#4180 (a driven PTY ignores input) and #4223 (a shell command never completes under tmux) report both failing on 1.0.70 to 1.0.74 and neither reproduces on 1.0.94. `COPILOT_HOME` and `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL` are privileged env keys, so a non-granted multi-user owner cannot set them through `envOverrides`.
