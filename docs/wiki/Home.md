<h3 align="center">Mission control for AI coding agents</h3>

Codeman runs your coding agents on your own machine and puts them behind one dashboard you
can open from any device. It spawns Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity, Gemini, Pi,
Grok, DeepSeek Harness, or OMP inside persistent tmux sessions, streams the real terminal to the browser, and keeps
working while you are away from the keyboard: it re-prompts idle agents, resumes when a
subscription limit resets, runs jobs on a schedule, and shows every background subagent
live.

This wiki is the manual. The [README](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman) is the overview,
and the deep internals live in
[`docs/`](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/tree/master/docs).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getcodeman.com/install | bash
codeman web    # then open http://localhost:3000
```

## Requirements at a glance

| Thing        | Needed                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS           | macOS or Linux. Windows works through WSL2.                                 |
| Node.js      | 22 or newer.                                                                |
| tmux         | Required. Sessions live in tmux, which is what makes them survive restarts.  |
| An agent CLI | At least one of Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Pi, Grok Build, DeepSeek Harness, OMP. Plain shell sessions need none. |
| Network      | Binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Reaching it from another device is a deliberate step: see [Remote Access](Remote-Access). |

Codeman is MIT licensed, self-hosted, and sends no telemetry. Everything runs on your
