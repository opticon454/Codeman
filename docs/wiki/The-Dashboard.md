# The Dashboard

What the interface is telling you, and which parts of it are hidden until you turn them on.

Most of Codeman's UI is **opt-in**. A stock install shows a deliberately small header, and a
feature you read about here may simply not be on screen yet. Where that is the case, this
page says so and names the setting.

## Layout

| Region             | What lives there                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header, left**   | The "C" logo (goes home) and the session list, unless you moved it to the sidebar.       |
| **Header, right**  | Status chips and panel buttons, most of them off by default.                            |
| **Center**         | The terminal for the active session, or the home screen when nothing is selected.        |
| **Bottom toolbar** | Run, Stop, Run Shell, the case picker, and the instance counter.                         |
| **Overlays**       | Panels and modals: Respawn, Cron, Subagents, File Viewer, Settings.                      |

## Session list layout

The session list lives in the header as a horizontal strip by default. With a lot of
sessions open that strip stops being scannable, so **App Settings → Appearance → Tabs →
Session List Layout** can move it into a vertical sidebar on the left instead, and
**Tab Orientation** can turn the strip itself into a vertical rail.

| Layout               | Behaviour                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header tab strip** | The default. One list in tab order unless you pick another [Tab layout](#tab-layouts); it scrolls sideways on a phone. |
| **Left sidebar**     | A vertical list with a filter box and a live session count. `Alt+B` collapses it to a narrow rail that keeps the status dots and task badges visible. On a phone it is an off-canvas drawer rather than a docked rail. A detailed variant adds the home screen's per-session line (`created 3d ago · working 12m`) and a status pill. |
| **Vertical rail**    | The strip turned vertical beside the terminal, resizable, with detailed rows by default. **Vertical Rail Order** sorts it by activity (blocked on you first, then longest running, then most recently quiet), the same order as the home screens; pick *Manual* to get your own order and drag-reordering back. **Tab groups:** pick *Move to new group* from a row's ⋯ menu (or Shift+F10 on it) to make the first one; a group header's menu (right-click, Shift+F10 or its ⋯ glyph) renames it (also F2), reorders or deletes it, rows move between groups from their own menu or by dragging with a mouse or pen, and a collapsed group stays collapsed on that device. **Search sessions** at the top of the rail narrows it to the tabs whose name matches (a web tab by its title), across every group, collapsed ones included, without changing the groups or the order; a tab with an alert stays visible even when its name does not match; Escape or × clears it, and it is never saved. Desktop and tablet only. |

It is the same list either way, just re-hosted: tab order, drag-to-reorder, the `Alt+1`
to `Alt+9` numbers and every status colour below behave identically in both. The setting is
per device, so a sidebar on your desktop does not force one onto your phone.

## Tab layouts

**App Settings → Appearance → Tabs → Tab Layout** picks how the tabs are arranged. Per device.

| Layout                 | What it does                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **By state**           | Groups the tabs by what each session needs from you (below).                         |
| **By case**            | One box per case, labelled with the case and its tab count. Inside a box, `w75-api-gateway` reads just `w75`. A case with one tab gets a box with a colour swatch. |
| **Ledger**             | The same list on an aligned column grid: equal cells, monospace names, a coloured bar on the left of each cell instead of the dot (yellow waiting, red needs you). Desktop header only. |
| **Classic** (default)  | The single list in tab order, as before.                                             |

**By state** groups the tabs like this, most urgent on top:

| Group         | Who is in it                                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Needs you** | Red: a question or permission prompt is blocking the agent. A failed session too.   |
| **Waiting**   | Yellow: the agent finished its turn and is waiting for your next prompt.            |
| **Working**   | A turn is running.                                                                  |
| **Idle**      | Everything quiet, including ended sessions, agents that exited inside their pane, and web tabs. |

In the header each group is a row with its name and count on the left (Idle, the quiet
default, carries no label); a group with more tabs than fit on one line continues on the
next line. **State Order → Needs you at the
bottom** turns the rows the other way up, so the needs-you row sits right above the
terminal. Empty groups are not shown. These are the same states the phone overview and the
desktop home rail use, and tabs move between groups on their own as their state changes.

Both groupings also apply to the vertical rail and the left sidebar, as labelled sections.
Inside a group or a box tabs keep your tab order (on a rail sorted *By activity*, the
activity order), and the `Alt+1` to `Alt+9` numbers never change. Dragging reorders tabs
within a group or box. On a phone the strip stays a single scrolling row in group order,
without labels or boxes. If you have named tab groups in the vertical rail, those take
precedence there.

## Session tabs

One tab per session, in your order, and that order syncs across your devices.

An agent tab shows its CLI's logo before the name, and a shell tab an `SH` badge. **CLI Logos
on Tabs** (App Settings → Appearance → Tabs) hides the logos on that device; the tile and split
headers and the Run menus keep theirs.

**Status is carried by the dot and the tab's own styling:**

| Look                          | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Green dot                     | Alive, not currently working.                                            |
| Pulsing green dot with a ring | Working on a turn.                                                       |
| Yellow tab, blinking          | The agent is waiting for input from you.                                 |
| Red tab, blinking             | A question or permission prompt is blocking the session.                 |
| No dot                        | The session is not running.                                              |
| Muted grey dot plus an `exited (137)` badge | The agent inside the pane has exited, with that exit code (or `exited (signal 9)`). A bare `exited` means tmux saw the pane die but did not report how, which is not the same as a clean `exited (0)`. Detailed sidebar and rail rows read `exited` in their pill. |

![Tab alerts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ark0N/Codeman/master/docs/images/tab-alerts-20260815.png)

The alert states are steady colour with a pulse layered on top, not a blink between the
alert colour and nothing, so a tab that needs you looks like it needs you at every point in
the cycle. They survive a page reload: the state is re-seeded from the server on load, so
reloading while a permission prompt is blocking does not lose the red tab.

**Navigation:**

| Action                          | Keys                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jump to tab N                   | `Alt+1` to `Alt+9` (the number on the tab)              |
| Next / previous                 | `Ctrl+Tab`, `Alt+[`, `Alt+]`                            |
| Move the active tab             | `Ctrl+Shift+{`, `Ctrl+Shift+}`                          |
| Close                           | The tab's close control (no key by default)            |
| Find any session, open or past  | `Ctrl+K` (also `Cmd+K` and `Alt+K`)                     |

Tabs can also be dragged to reorder.

### Automatic session names

Off by default. Turn on **Auto-name Sessions** (App Settings → Appearance → Tabs; synced
across devices) and a tab that still carries its generated name, such as `w3-myapp`, takes a
title from the first real prompt you submit, keeping the prefix: `w3-myapp: fix the login
redirect`. The strip shows the title and keeps the prefix in the tooltip, and the next
session in that case still counts up to `w4-myapp`. It happens once per session, only for
prompts you type or send through the input API (never a Ralph, respawn, cron or approval
answer), and never for shells. Slash commands such as `/clear` do not become titles; the
next prompt gets its turn. A name you set yourself, before or after, is never touched. The
title is derived locally from the prompt's first sentence; no text leaves the machine.

On phones the strip scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping, and the active tab is always
scrolled into view. It is not reordered to the front, so the `Alt+N` numbering stays stable.

### Lineage lines

When one session spawns another (an agent starting a worker through the API), Codeman draws
lines from the parent to each child, in the parent's colour, routed through the gaps between
tab rows so they never cover a tab or the terminal. Every family is always shown; selecting
a tab draws its own family thicker and brighter. A dashed branch means that child is
working. It is how a fan-out of eight workers stays readable.

While any tab has spawned another, the strip keeps a little extra room between rows for the
lines, so switching tabs never changes the header height.

Desktop only, and on by default. Turn it off in **App Settings → Appearance**. Lines are
skipped for tabs scrolled out of the strip.

## Header controls

The right side of the header. Almost all of these are off until you enable them in
**App Settings → Header & Panels**.

| Control                | Default            | What it does                                                                    |

| Away Digest            | Off                | What happened while you were gone.                                               |
| Last Response          | Off                | Readable view of the agent's last answer, useful on phones.                      |

### Header Stats Style

The connection readout, CPU, MEM and the plan usage windows can be drawn three ways
(**App Settings → Header & Panels → Header Stats Style**, per device, desktop only):

| Style          | Look                                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tiles**      | One small tile each (`WS live`, `CPU 22%`, `MEM 14.4G`, `5H 28%`, `7D 35%`): label over value, a thin bar underneath, no icons. |
| **Compact**    | The default. Two slim pills, `WS · CPU · MEM` and the plan windows, with a small ring beside every value. Hands the tabs back the most room. |
| **As before**  | The bars and the `5H · 7D` chip, exactly as they were.                                 |

Hiding System Stats or Plan Usage still hides them in every style.

New header controls never appear on phones. Phone layout is deliberately minimal and is
covered in [Mobile Guide](Mobile-Guide).

## Bottom bar

**Git status** sits at the right of the bottom bar and shows the active session's uncommitted
and unpushed work. It is off by default and per device: turn it on in **App Settings → Header &
Panels → Bottom bar**. Click it for the Git window. See
[Working With Files](Working-With-Files#git-changes).

## Connection state

The dot in the header is the quick read. Two louder surfaces exist because a cached page
with no server behind it used to look identical to a page with no sessions:

- **A full-screen overlay** when the page has never loaded server state. There is nothing
  behind it worth preserving.
- **A banner** when the connection drops after state had loaded, so your scrollback stays
  readable.

Both wait about 2.5 seconds before appearing, so a deploy that restarts the server does not
flash a warning at you every time. If the browser reports itself offline, the grace period
is skipped.

There is also a watchdog for the case where the connection stops delivering without
erroring. If the server's heartbeat stops arriving, Codeman reconnects on its own rather
than sitting on a green dot showing frozen data.

## The terminal

A real terminal: xterm.js in the browser, a real PTY on the server, tmux in between. Full
TUIs render correctly.

Worth knowing:

- **Scrollback.** Agent/TUI sessions pull their entire tmux scrollback on first open.
  Shell sessions open from a bounded recent tail so a large transcript cannot stall tab
  switching. Scrolling to the top of a Shell pane pulls the most recent 1 MiB of its tmux
  history; press **Load full history** to pull the rest explicitly. Automatic output
  recovery stays within the bounded browser buffer.
- **Wheel and touch scrolling** are forwarded into Claude's own transcript when a recent
  Claude runs fullscreen (`CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1`, or `"tui": "fullscreen"` in
  `~/.claude/settings.json`), so the wheel scrolls the conversation rather than the terminal.
  Claude's default inline view keeps its history in the terminal and scrolls locally. `Shift+Wheel` is
  always local scrollback. OpenCode's wheel and swipes page its own conversation
  (PageUp/PageDown); in a grid tile or the split view's second pane the wheel does
  too. Other CLIs scroll locally.
- **Selection copy.** `Ctrl+C` copies when text is selected and interrupts when it is not.
  `Ctrl+Shift+C` always copies.
- **Selecting where the CLI owns the mouse.** `Shift+drag` starts a selection even in a pane
  whose mouse events are forwarded to the CLI, and right-click copies the selection (with
  nothing selected the native menu is left alone). **Auto Copy Selection** in App Settings
  copies the moment you release.
- **Zero-lag input.** On touch devices, keystrokes paint locally before the round trip. See
  [Input And Voice](Input-And-Voice).
- **Renderer.** WebGL by default, with a watchdog that falls back to DOM rendering if the
  GPU stalls. `?nowebgl` forces DOM rendering for one page load.

## The home screen

With no session selected you get the welcome screen: run buttons for the CLIs Codeman
found, a QR code when a password is set, cross-session search, and **Resume Conversation**,
which lists past sessions including Claude conversations started outside Codeman entirely.

Two extras depending on the device:

- **Desktop, wide windows**: your open tabs appear as a rail docked to the left edge, in
  overview order (blocked on you first, then longest running, then most recently quiet),
  with created and state-duration stamps. It needs at least 1180px of width; below that
  it is hidden so it cannot overlap the search panel.
- **Phones**: tapping the "C" logo gives a session overview instead: NEEDS YOU first, then
  current sessions, then past ones. On by default.

Session-specific configuration lives in **Session Options**, reachable from the tab. App
Settings is global; Session Options is per session.

## Search and the session palette

`Ctrl+K` opens the session palette: every session, live or historical, filtered as you
type. Picking a past one resumes its conversation.

The search box on the home screen is wider in scope. It federates over session metadata,
run-summary events, and attachment history, filtered by type, case, status, and date. It
does substring matching over data already in memory, with no regex and no filesystem reads,
so it is fast and cannot be turned into a traversal.

## Appearance

**App Settings → Appearance** carries the theme skins, including light ones. The choice is
applied before the first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme on load. Terminal
font family and weight are per device too: a normal and a bold weight, each from 100 to
900, and the bundled JetBrains Mono renders every step.

The same section has the entrance animations for tabs, terminals, agent windows, and
lineage lines. All of them default to the legacy no-animation behaviour, so an untouched
install animates nothing.
