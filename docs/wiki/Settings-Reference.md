# Settings Reference

Two settings surfaces, and the rule that explains why a setting you changed on your laptop
did not follow you to your phone.

| Surface             | Scope                          | Opened from                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **App Settings**    | Global, this Codeman install.  | The header gear.             |
| **Session Options** | One session.                   | The session's tab.           |

App Settings is a single scrolling document with a rail acting as a table of contents;
clicking a rail entry scrolls rather than switching. Session Options genuinely switches
panels.

## Per-device versus synced

Some settings live on the server and follow you to every device. Others are stored in the
browser and stay put. This is deliberate, not an oversight: your phone wants a different
font size, a different keyboard bar, and a different set of header buttons than your
desktop.

| Category                | Examples                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Per-device, local**   | Skin, WebGL renderer, local echo, CJK input, extended keyboard bar, File Viewer and Cron header buttons. Never sent to the server at all. |
| **Per-device policy**   | Most `show*` toggles, plan usage chip, language. Stored server-side, but a device only takes the server value when it has no local one of its own. |
| **Synced**              | Models, effort, CLI options, notification preferences, voice settings, display name, the agent skill and approvals toggles. |

The practical rule: **appearance and input are per device, behaviour is shared.** If a change
did not follow you, it is in one of the first two rows, and you change it again on that
device.

## App Settings

### Updates

Current version, a manual check, and the in-app updater. Covers git-clone installs
supervised by systemd or launchd; npm installs report as non-updatable. See
[Running As A Service](Running-As-A-Service).

### Terminal & Input

| Setting                       | Default              | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Echo                    | On for touch devices | Paints keystrokes locally and flushes on Enter. See [Input And Voice](Input-And-Voice). |
| CJK Input                     | Off                  | IME composition through a dedicated text field.                        |
| Extended Keyboard Bar         | Per device           | Which accessory bar phones get. Shell sessions override it while they are active. |
| Wheel Scrolls Local History   | Off                  | Keeps the wheel on the local buffer instead of forwarding it to the CLI. |
| Auto Copy Selection           | Off                  | Copies highlighted terminal text to the clipboard the moment you finish selecting it. Ctrl+C still copies on demand. |
| Trim The Pane Margin On Copy  | On                   | Takes the left margin a full-screen agent CLI paints down its own edge off a copy, so the text pastes flush. Each CLI declares its own width, and the strip never exceeds the indent every selected line shares, so nesting is kept. Claude Code and Codex declare a margin; a shell does not. |
| Normal / Bold font weight     | xterm defaults       | Per device, each slot from 100 to 900. The bundled JetBrains Mono renders every step, so a lighter normal weight makes Claude's bold headings stand out. Applies live to the terminal, both echo overlays and open team panes. |
| WebGL Renderer                | On                   | With a GPU-stall watchdog that falls back to DOM rendering.            |
| Gesture Control               | Off                  | Camera hand tracking. Also needs `CODEMAN_GESTURE=1` on the server.    |
| Key tester                    | n/a                  | A diagnostic that stores nothing. Click the box and press keys to see what this browser reports (key, code, modifiers) for keydown, keypress and keyup, for when a chord such as Shift+Enter behaves differently on one device. Keys pressed there reach no session and trigger no shortcut. |

### Header & Panels

Chips for every optional header control, with a live preview of the resulting header:

Run, Font Size, System Stats, Redraw Terminal, Response Viewer, Away Digest, Session
Manager, Attachments, File Viewer, Multi-monitor, Split, Tiles, Plan Usage, Lifecycle Log, Monitor,
Project Insights, File Browser, Subagents, Approvals Inbox, Read My Mind, Ultracode Agents,
Ultracode Windows, Cron.

**Bottom bar** (below the chips): **Git status** shows a small indicator at the right of the
bottom bar, off by default and per device. It reads `● N` uncommitted files, `↑ N` commits not
pushed, `⚠ N` merge conflicts, `? N` repositories git could not read, or `✓` when everything is
committed and pushed. Click it for the Git window; see
[Working With Files](Working-With-Files#git-changes). **Git status: group files
by folder** (per device, on by default) shows changed files under collapsed folders in that
window; off lists every file by its full path. **Git status: max repositories** (per device,
1 to 50, default 12) is how many repositories the window lists when a session's folder holds
several projects. **Git status: git timeout** (per device, 5 to 120 seconds, default 30) is how
long one git command may run before that repository is reported as unreadable; raise it for
repositories on a slow network share.

Most default to off. The stock desktop header is system stats, File Viewer, Tiles, and the gear.
**Header Stats Style** picks how the system stats and plan usage are drawn: *Compact*
(default; two pills with a ring beside every value), *Tiles* (label over value with a bar underneath) or *As before* (the bars and the `5H · 7D` chip). Desktop only, per device.
New header controls never appear on phones. Split is desktop-only regardless of this
setting — the button and the feature both stay off below a ~1180px viewport, where two
resizable panes plus their divider have nowhere to go. **Tiles** is desktop-only the same
way; it also enables the `Ctrl+Shift+G` grid toggle on this device. See
[Tile Grid](Tile-Grid).

This section also holds background-agent tracking, including whether to track agents for
every session or only the active tab.

### Appearance

| Setting                | Notes                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skin                   | Theme palettes, light ones included. Applied before first paint, so no flash of the wrong theme. |
| Display Name           | Your name in the UI. Cosmetic only; it never renames the package, CLI, API, or storage.    |
| Interface Language     | English or Simplified Chinese. Per device.                                                 |
| Session List Layout    | Header tab strip (default), a collapsible left sidebar, or the sidebar with detailed rows. See [The Dashboard](The-Dashboard#session-list-layout). |
| Tab Orientation        | Keeps the header list but turns the strip vertical beside the terminal, resizable, with detailed rows by default. Desktop and tablet only. |
| Tab Layout             | *Classic* (default): the single list as before. *By state*: a row each for needs you, waiting, working and idle, sections in the rail and sidebar. *By case*: one box per case. *Ledger*: an aligned column grid. See [The Dashboard](The-Dashboard#tab-layouts). |
| State Order            | For *By state*: needs you on top (default) or at the bottom, right above the terminal. |
| Vertical Rail Order    | *By activity* (default) sorts the rail the way the home screens are sorted; *Manual* keeps your tab order and drag-reordering. With *By state* or *By case* it orders the rows inside each section. |
| Tall Tabs              | Taller tab strip.                                                                          |
| CLI Logos on Tabs      | Each agent tab, and its row on the desktop home rail, shows the CLI's logo before the name. Off hides those logos on this device; the status dot and the shell's SH badge stay, and tiles, split headers and the Run menus keep their logos. On by default. |
| Pop-out Button on Tabs | Adds the detach control to tabs, with a per-tab override.                                  |
| Spawn Lineage Lines    | Lines from each tab to the sessions it spawned; the selected tab's family is drawn thicker. Desktop only, on by default. |
| Auto-name Sessions     | Titles a new tab after its first prompt, keeping the case prefix (`w3-myapp: fix the login redirect`). Synced, off by default. See [The Dashboard](The-Dashboard#automatic-session-names). |
| Overview Home Screen   | The phone home screen. On by default.                                                      |

### Animations

All per device, all off by default, applied as you pick them.

| Setting                | Notes                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entrance Theme         | One look for how new tabs, terminal panes, agent windows and their lines arrive (Terminal, Beam down, Launch, Soft focus, Quiet, Playful). Off by default. |
| Tile Animations        | How tiles arrive when the tile grid opens and leave when it closes: fly out of their tabs, dealt from the Tiles button, CRT, beam down, cascade, pop or soft; each screen then plays the theme's terminal animation. Off by default (the grid's quick fade); picking a theme presets it. |
| Animation Lab          | Opens the per-surface lab (the same as `?animlab=1`): every style side by side, with replay, stagger and speed. Closes settings first. |

### Models

Claude model cards, the 1M context window switch, the thinking effort segment and the
advisor segment. The cards and the switch compose into one model choice, so there is no
separate "which one wins" question.

Model, effort and advisor are all **soft defaults**: the model is written into the case's
`.claude/settings.local.json` and effort and advisor are passed at start, so `/model`,
`/effort` and `/advisor` inside a session override them at any time.

**Advisor** gives new Claude sessions Claude Code's
[advisor tool](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/advisor): a second, stronger model that Claude
consults before committing to an approach, when an error keeps coming back, and before it
calls a task done. A common pairing is a Sonnet main model with an Opus or Fable advisor,
which costs less than running the stronger model all the time. **Default** leaves it to
whatever you picked with `/advisor` yourself. The advisor needs the Anthropic API (not
Bedrock or Vertex), and an advisor that ranks below the session's model is simply not
attached.

**Custom model endpoints** (off by default) adds a saved-endpoint list plus a matching
section to the Run dropdown, for pointing a harness at your own OpenAI-compatible server
instead of its native cloud backend. See [Custom Model Endpoints](Custom-Model-Endpoints).

### Agents & CLIs

| Setting                          | Notes                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Startup Mode                     | Claude's permission mode for new sessions. Default skips prompts; `auto` uses Anthropic's classifier-guarded mode; `normal` prompts; or give an explicit allowed-tools list. |
| Allowed Tools                    | The list used by the explicit mode.                                                            |
| Ralph / Todo Tracker             | Enables the Ralph loop surfaces.                                                               |
| Agent Teams                      | Experimental teams. Also needs the CLI's own environment flag.                                 |
| Codeman Agent Skill              | Injects the agent skill into new Claude sessions per case. Off by default. See [Driving Codeman From An Agent](Driving-Codeman-From-An-Agent). |
| Remote auto-reconnect            | Reattaches dropped remote SSH sessions. On by default.                                         |
| Nice priority / value            | Runs agent processes at a lower CPU priority.                                                  |
| Default Codex model              | Model for new local Codex sessions; empty uses Codex's own config. Letters, digits, `.` `_` `-` `/` only. |
| Default Codex reasoning effort   | Reasoning level for new local Codex sessions; empty uses Codex's own config.                   |
| Bypass approvals and sandbox     | Starts new Codex sessions with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. Read [Agent CLIs](Agent-CLIs) before enabling. |
| Animated status effects          | Cosmetic.                                                                                      |
| MCP server sync                  | Copies the MCP servers each installed, enabled CLI (Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Antigravity) and GitHub Copilot CLI has into the others' own config files. Synced, off by default, admin only in multi-user mode. Turn it on and **Apply** or **Save** (Apply keeps Settings open), then **Preview** shows what would change and **Sync now** applies it. It only adds missing servers, keeps the previous file as `.codeman-bak`, and leaves a file that receives env values or headers readable by you only. A config dir moved by `CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` or `COPILOT_HOME` in Codeman's own environment is followed. |

### Notifications

Master toggle, browser notifications, push subscription, audio alerts, how long a
corner toast stays on screen (**Toast display time**, 1 to 300 seconds, default 3) and
how long a desktop notification stays up before Codeman closes it (**Browser
notification display time**, default 8; both per device, and your OS may close a
desktop notification sooner), the idle
threshold that decides when a quiet session counts as needing you, and the server-wide
webhook (ntfy, Slack, Discord or generic JSON; admins only in multi-user mode). See
[Notifications And Approvals](Notifications-And-Approvals).

### Voice

Active provider and the engine behind it, insert mode, language, domain keywords to bias
recognition, the Deepgram API key, and the opt-in switch for transcribing through this
server's Claude login, with its live credential status. See
[Input And Voice](Input-And-Voice).

### Shortcuts

Rebinding for the shortcut registry. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](Keyboard-Shortcuts).

### System

`CLAUDE.md` template for new cases, default working directory, the image watcher, and
Cloudflare tunnel controls including the tunnel URL. The **Diagnostics** group runs
`codeman doctor` on the server and lists the agent CLIs, tmux, Node and the optional office
tools with their versions and install hints (admin only in multi-user mode). In multi-user
mode, the **Users** administration entry is injected here.

The **Config backups** group controls timestamped copies of your configuration files: an
on/off switch (on by default), the backup folder (default `~/.codeman/backups/config`), how
many backups to keep (1 to 500, default 20) and how many days to keep them (0 to 3650, default
30; 0 means no age limit), plus **Back up now** and a list with **Restore**. These are
server-side settings, read fresh. Details, naming and restore behaviour are on
[Config Backups](Config-Backups).

## Session Options

Per session, from the tab.

| Panel            | Contains                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Respawn**      | Auto-resume on usage limit, the respawn cycle configuration, presets, duration. See [Keeping Agents Running](Keeping-Agents-Running). |
| **Session**      | Name, working directory, environment overrides, per-tab pop-out override.                    |
| **Ralph / Todo** | Loop configuration, iteration and todo caps, circuit breaker reset. See [Autonomous Loops](Autonomous-Loops). |
| **Summary**      | What this session has done: tokens, activity, run summary.                                   |

Panels that only make sense for Claude are hidden for other run modes rather than shown and
failing.

## Environment variables

Some things are configured before the server starts, not in the UI:

| Variable                            | Effect                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CODEMAN_PORT`                      | Listen port.                                                            |
| `CODEMAN_HOST`                      | Bind address. Loopback by default.                                      |
| `CODEMAN_PASSWORD` / `CODEMAN_USERNAME` | HTTP Basic credentials. Username defaults to `admin`.               |
| `CODEMAN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`             | Extra Host and Origin allowlist entries for a reverse proxy.            |
| `CODEMAN_INSTANCE`                  | Scopes the data directory and tmux socket together. Required for a second instance. |
| `CODEMAN_MULTIUSER`                 | Enables multi-user mode.                                                |
| `CODEMAN_GESTURE`                   | Makes gesture control available to be enabled.                          |
| `CODEMAN_DOCKER_BRIDGE_HOOKS`       | Lets in-container hooks reach the host on a loopback bind.              |
| `CODEMAN_FILE_PICKER_ROOTS`         | Extra roots for the path picker.                                        |
| `CODEMAN_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_NETWORK` | Acknowledges exposing the server with no password.                  |
| `CODEMAN_BASE_URL`                  | Mounts Codeman under a sub-path behind a reverse proxy that forwards the prefix unchanged. See [Remote Access](Remote-Access). |
| `CODEMAN_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`        | Cap on raw file bodies and downloads. 2 GB by default, `0` for none.    |
| `CODEMAN_MAX_REMOTE_FILE_SSH`       | Concurrent ssh reads for files in remote cases. 4 by default.           |
| `CODEMAN_PATH_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`     | How long a linked case's folder may take to answer before it is shown as unreachable. 1500 ms by default; raise it for a slow but healthy mount. |
| `CODEMAN_PATH_PROBE_MAX_STALLED`    | Unanswered folder checks allowed to pile up before new ones are refused. 2 by default: one below the threadpool size minus one, so it follows `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` (4 unless set), and it is never allowed above that ceiling. A check you start by opening one case or session may use the one slot left above it. |

## Gotchas

- **A setting that did not sync is per device.** Change it again on that device.
- **The plan usage chip and its telemetry exporter are one setting.** Enabling the chip
  without the exporter would leave it blank forever, so it is deliberately not separable.
- **Toggling a header button does nothing on a phone.** Phones deliberately ignore most of
  the header chips.
- **Enabling a feature does not retroactively configure existing sessions.** The agent skill
  injection, for instance, applies at session creation.
