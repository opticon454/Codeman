# ^[@A-Za-z0-9][@A-Za-z0-9/._-]*$ on the producing side

#
# ⚠️ Filtered on each entry's `enabled` flag, so a CLI that ships disabled is
# never baked into every image.
#
# Pinning is left to the rebuild cadence (see docs/docker-cases-plan.md,
# user-decision 2).
# ⚠️ The default is in REGISTRY order, byte-identical to what the generator emits.
# A different order is a different RUN string, which is a different layer hash and

# DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`). A normal npm package, but the ONLY entry here whose

# profile itself is installed further down, into the `agent` HOME, because
# Codeman deliberately does NOT seed `profiles/` from the host: it is a
# per-profile node_modules tree, host-arch-specific and far too large to copy on
# every container start.
# ⚠️ `pnpm` is a HARD dependency of `dsh plugin`, not optional tooling: the
# subcommand is a thin forwarder that `spawnSync`s a literal `pnpm` with no
# fallback to npm, so on an image without it the profile install below dies
# with `dsh: pnpm not found on PATH` / exit 127 and takes the whole build with
# it (issue #352). It stays on PATH at runtime too, so a container user can run

# `.claude` (+ `.claude/projects` mount point) and `.codex` (+ `.codex/sessions`) are
# pre-created gid-0 group-writable so the container owns its OWN credential config
# dirs: tokens/settings/config are seeded in as writable copies and each CLI's runtime
# state (backups, tasks, refreshed tokens) stays container-local, while ONLY the shared
# transcript/rollout dirs (`.claude/projects`, `.codex/sessions`) are bind-mounted from
# the host. (gemini/gcloud/opencode are whole seed-copies and need no pre-created dir;
# Antigravity nests its state inside `.gemini/antigravity-cli`, so it rides that seed.)
# `.pi/agent` and `.grok` ARE pre-created: both are seeded per-FILE (pi:
# auth/settings/trust/models; grok: auth.json/config.toml/pager.toml), and a
# per-file seed copy, unlike a whole-dir one, does not create its parent directory.
# `.dsh` is pre-created for the same per-file reason (.env/settings.yaml/
# cordis.patch.yml), and the interactive profile is built into it HERE rather than
# after `USER agent`: this layer's closing chgrp/chmod is what makes the whole tree
# writable by the arbitrary uid the container actually runs as, and a profile
# installed after it would miss that fixup. DSH_HOME points the launcher at the
# agent's dir while this still runs as root.
# ⚠️ `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` is what keeps that profile install from becoming
# the next #352. pnpm (unlike npm) blocks dependency lifecycle scripts by default
# and FAILS the install over it — `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, exit 1, measured on
# pnpm 11.24 — so any package in the tui's tree that ships one stops the build
# dead. An allowlist of the offenders rots: `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` is
# resolved by dist-tag, not pinned, and 0.9.3 pulled `@google/genai` (a
# `preinstall: no-op`) where 0.10.0-beta.x does not, so the names to allow move
# under us between rebuilds. Allowing them wholesale is also the SAME exposure
# this image already accepts three layers up: `npm install -g` runs the install
# scripts of every transitive dep of the five CLIs above it, with no gate at all.
# `.omp/agent` is pre-created for the same reason `.codex` is: it is a MIXED
# store (per-file config seeds PLUS a shared `sessions/` RW bind mount for
# Codeman's own host-side history/resume reads), and neither kind of artifact
# creates its own parent directory.
