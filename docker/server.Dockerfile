# The Docker CLI, taken from the official image rather than Debian's `docker.io`.
# That package is the full ENGINE: with --no-install-recommends it still pulls 15
# packages including containerd, runc, dmsetup and iptables, none of which a
# client that only talks to a mounted socket can use. Measured on top of this
# base image: `docker.io` costs 266 MB and ships Docker 20.10.24 (2023), while
# these two files cost 108 MB and ship the current CLI (493 MB vs 335 MB total).
#
# The binaries are STATIC Go builds, so they run on this glibc image even though
# the image they come from is Alpine (verified: `docker --version`, `docker ps`
# and `docker build` all work here against a mounted host socket).
#
# buildx is copied on purpose. `scripts/build-agent-image.mjs` shells out to
# `docker build` — Codeman auto-builds the agent image on the first Docker case —
# and without the plugin that silently falls back to the CLASSIC builder, which
# Docker has deprecated and will eventually drop. `docker-compose` is NOT copied:
# Codeman never shells out to it.

# GitHub CLI and Azure CLI (with the azure-devops extension), so a user can sign
# this container in to GitHub and Azure DevOps from a Codeman shell session and
# then clone PRIVATE repositories, both from that session and through Add Case
# -> Clone Repo. Codeman still collects no Git credentials itself: the clone
# path (src/git-clone.ts) only inherits HOME and git's config, so whatever the
# user signs in to here is what authenticates, and nothing when they have not
# (the clone then fails fast with AUTH_REQUIRED, exactly as before).
#
# Each is OPT-IN and OFF by default: the image is functionally unchanged
# unless the build gets CODEMAN_INSTALL_GH=1 and/or CODEMAN_INSTALL_AZ=1, which
# a deployment sets under `build: args:` in docker-compose.override.yml
# (docker/README.md, "Private repositories"). Off installs no apt repository,
# package, extension or credential-helper entry; all that remains is the
# AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR variable, its empty directory and one layer that copies
# and then removes the helper script. The Azure CLI is the heavy one (~600 MB,
# mostly its bundled Python). The base docker-compose.yaml
# and .env deliberately do not carry them: turning a CLI on is a per-host
# choice, which is what the override file is for, and a new .env.example key
# would make the self-updater refuse existing installs until their .env gained
# it (docs/docker-self-update.md).
#
# Both come from their vendors' own apt repositories, the same ones the
# documented one-liners configure (https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
# and https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt).
# Microsoft's `deb_install.sh` is deliberately not piped into the build: it does
# exactly this plus a `gnupg` install, and a remote script run at build time is
# the one step a reviewer cannot read in this file. apt reads an ASCII-armoured
# `.asc` key directly, which is what keeps `gnupg` out of the image.
#
# Not pinned, unlike the agent CLIs below: nothing in Codeman depends on a
# particular gh or az behaviour, so the pinning argument there does not apply.
# The layer cache still keeps whatever version the first build fetched until a
# --no-cache rebuild.

# Keep credentials out of the image. Users authenticate these CLIs at runtime

#
# Installed into a DEDICATED prefix, /opt/codeman-cli, not the base image's
# default /usr/local. A session needs write access to wherever these CLIs live
# so it can self-update one in place (observed via Codex's own
# `npm install -g @openai/codex`, which renames the old package directory
# aside before installing the new one — a rename needs write access to the
# PARENT directory, not just the target, so the runtime account needs that
# access at the directory level). Chowning /usr/local/bin and
# /usr/local/lib/node_modules directly to get it would ALSO hand away
# entrypoint.sh (COPY'd to /usr/local/bin below, root-owned, executed as root
# on every container start with CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/SETUID/SETGID) and the node
# binary: owning the DIRECTORY is enough to rename it aside and drop a
# replacement, even though the file itself stays root-owned, which would let a
# compromised session arrange for its own script to run as root at the next
# restart — undoing the "the server itself never runs privileged" guarantee
# the entrypoint exists to provide. /opt/codeman-cli holds nothing else to
# escalate through, so owning it is exactly the CLI-update access it needs and
# no more.
#
# ⚠️ PINNED ON PURPOSE. Unpinned, the agent CLI versions a user ends up with are
# a function of WHEN their image was built, not of any commit — so a Codeman
# release that depends on newer CLI behaviour (the trust-dialog handling is
# pinned to Claude Code 2.1.252's layout; wheel forwarding to >= 2.1.187) breaks
# on an older image with no diff anywhere to explain why. In-app updates make
# rebuilds RARER, which makes that drift worse. Pinning turns "this release needs
# a newer CLI" into a Dockerfile change, which the updater's environment gate
# already detects and refuses (docs/docker-self-update.md).
#
# Bump these deliberately, in a release. `--no-cache` is still needed to rebuild
# this layer when only the pins change upstream.
# The prefix is APPENDED to PATH, never prepended: it is chowned to the runtime
# account below, and entrypoint.sh runs as root calling stat/chown/setpriv by
# bare name. A prefix ahead of /usr/bin would let a session drop a `setpriv`
# there and have it run as root at the next container start (measured with a
# minimal image of this exact shape). The four CLIs live only in this prefix,
# so they still resolve; entrypoint.sh additionally pins its own PATH to the
# system directories for the root part of the start.
