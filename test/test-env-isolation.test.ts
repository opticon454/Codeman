/**
 * @fileoverview Pins the environment isolation `test/setup.ts` provides.
 *
 * The suite's hermeticity rests on a temp `HOME` plus a short list of env vars that are
 * deleted before any application module loads. That list is easy to under-maintain: it grew
 * once for auth (`CODEMAN_PASSWORD`/`CODEMAN_USERNAME`) and once for `CODEMAN_GESTURE`, both
 * times only after a leak had already produced a confusing failure, and it was still missing
 * the three INSTANCE-selection vars.
 *
 * Those three matter more than the ones already on the list, because `src/config/instance.ts`
 * derives BOTH the data dir and the tmux socket from them, and `CODEMAN_DATA_DIR` is an
 * absolute path that bypasses `HOME` entirely — so a developer who exports it has the suite
 * reading and writing their real `state.json` rather than a throwaway tree.
 *
 * ⚠️ The runtime half of this file cannot fail on a machine where the vars were never set, so
 * it is not enough on its own: a `delete` line removed from `setup.ts` would still pass here
 * on almost every developer's box and on CI. The STATIC half is what actually guards the
 * list — it reads `setup.ts` and asserts each name is deleted there, which fails wherever the
 * suite runs. Both halves are deliberate; do not drop the static one as redundant.
 *
 * Port: none (pure, over process.env and one source file).
