/**
 * @fileoverview Static guard: the packaged agent skill's run-mode enumerations stay in
 * step with the modes the server actually accepts.
 *
 * `skills/codeman/**` is injected into cases and read by agents driving Codeman over
 * HTTP, so a mode missing from its lists is not cosmetic: the agent is told a backend
 * does not exist, or that a whole-class caveat ("these modes write no transcript")
 * covers four modes when it covers five. Adding pi (#206) left every one of those lists
 * stale while CI stayed green, because nothing tied the prose to the schema.
 *
 * Two rules, both derived from the RUNTIME source of truth (the Zod enum in schemas.ts,
 * not a copy):
 *
 *  1. The `mode ∈ a|b|c` enumeration in endpoints.md is the mode list, exactly, and the
 *     per-CLI availability probe (`GET /api/<mode>/status`) is documented for every
 *     agent mode. That second half is the narrow, family-scoped answer to "should the
 *     endpoint scanner also check registered-to-documented?". In general it should not:
 *     the skill documents 34 of 217 registered endpoints on purpose (it is an agent
 *     guide, not an API reference), so a blanket reverse check needs a 183-entry
 *     allowlist that fails CI on unrelated routes and gets appended to mechanically.
 *     Grouping by path shape does not rescue it either: the families that produces are
 *     things like `DELETE /api/<any>/:id`, which lumps cases, webviews and docker hosts
 *     together. A family the SCHEMA can enumerate is the exception, since it needs no
 *     allowlist at all.
 *  2. Any prose enumeration of 3+ distinct modes must be COMPLETE with respect to the
 *     external CLIs: those lists exist to describe what `isExternalCliMode()` gates
 *     (no Claude transcript, no hooks, no Claude-format parsers), so naming some but
 *     not all of them is the drift itself. Runs of one or two modes are exempt, since
 *     a legitimate pair ("claude or shell") is not a class claim. ONE exception is
 *     allowed and it is a real one: the "writes no transcript" lists drop `codex`,
 *     which does write a rollout Codeman reads back (the pane carries a unique
 *     originator precisely so `last-response` can find it), so external-minus-codex
 *     is a meaningful class rather than an oversight.
 *
 * Port: N/A (pure static analysis).
