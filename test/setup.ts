/**
 * @fileoverview Global test setup for Codeman tests
 *
 * SAFETY: The suite gets a temporary HOME and explicitly enables runtime test
 * mode before application modules load. Tests therefore cannot touch the real
 * Codeman state/cases tree or launch external tmux-backed agent sessions.
 *
 * This setup file strips shell-level configuration that can leak from a running
 * Codeman instance — auth (`CODEMAN_PASSWORD`/`CODEMAN_USERNAME`), the gesture
 * flag, and the three INSTANCE-selection vars that would otherwise point the
 * suite at a real data dir or tmux socket — then handles mock/timer cleanup
 * between tests.

// CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (#255) relocates Claude's whole tree, transcripts included, and
// `claudeProjectsDir()` reads it before it ever looks at `homedir()`. A developer who runs
// Codeman against a separate Claude account exports exactly this, and every test that writes
// a transcript fixture under the temp HOME's `~/.claude/projects` then reads "no transcript"
// (found at merge of #467: test/session-custom-model-restart.test.ts went red).

// Instance selection is PROCESS-WIDE and is what `src/config/instance.ts` derives
// both the data dir and the tmux socket from, so a shell that exports any of these
// three reaches straight past the temp HOME above and undoes the isolation this
// file exists to provide:
//
//   - CODEMAN_DATA_DIR is the dangerous one. It is an ABSOLUTE override read in
//     `getDataDir()`, so it bypasses HOME entirely: a developer who exports it
//     (or a shell left over from `codeman web -d`) has the suite reading and
//     WRITING their real `state.json`, `users.json`, `intents.json` and
//     `hook-secret` instead of a throwaway tree. Found live 2026-08-29 (#356):
//     `session-routes-workspace-hooks.test.ts` overwrote a production
//     `remote-hosts.json` with its `h1/box/10.0.0.5` fixture. `os.homedir()`
//     itself DOES follow `$HOME`, so with this var gone `getDataDir()` lands
//     under the temp HOME like everything else. (#356 first answered this by
//     pointing the var at a second throwaway dir; deleting it is the same
//     protection with one tree to clean up.)
//   - CODEMAN_INSTANCE moves the data dir to `~/.codeman-<name>` and the socket to
//     `codeman-<name>`. Inside the temp HOME that is not a data-loss risk, but it
//     silently changes the paths tests assert on — and `scripts/run-beta.sh`
//     exports it, so any shell that has run a beta carries it.
//   - CODEMAN_TMUX_SOCKET renames the socket `resolveTmuxSocketName()` returns.
//     `TmuxManager` no-ops its shell commands under vitest, so this is assertion
//     drift rather than a stray `tmux -L` against prod — but it is the same class
//     of leak and the same one-line fix.
//
// ⚠️ These must be deleted HERE rather than in a test, because `CODEMAN_INSTANCE`
// is captured into a module-level const the first time `config/instance.ts` is
// imported. A setup file runs before any application module loads; a beforeEach
// would already be too late.
