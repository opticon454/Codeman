/**
 * @fileoverview Resolve the DeepSeek Harness CLI (`dsh`) binary and its bootable profiles.
 *
 * Mirrors pi-cli-resolver.ts / grok-cli-resolver.ts, but the identity probe here
 * is STRICTER than either, and deliberately so: `dsh` is not merely a short name
 * with npm squatters, it is an EXISTING, widely packaged Unix program. Debian and
 * Ubuntu ship `dsh` = "dancer's shell" / distributed shell (`apt install dsh`),
 * which like nearly every Unix tool prints a version-shaped string of its own.
 * A version-token probe alone (which is all pi and grok need) would
 * therefore ACCEPT dancer's shell as the DeepSeek Harness and hand it to a spawn
 * line, so every candidate must additionally prove its identity by printing the
 * harness's own help banner.
 *
 * Two probes per candidate, both bounded and both cached behind the shared
 * resolver's positive/negative caching:
 *   1. `dsh --help`    must match DEEPSEEK_IDENTITY_REGEX (`DeepSeek Harness`)
 *   2. `dsh --version` must yield a version token (real output: `0.1.1-rc.2`)
 * Order matters: identity is checked FIRST, so a foreign `dsh` is rejected on the
 * cheaper, more discriminating signal and never contributes a version number.
 *
 * `dsh` is a profile LAUNCHER, not an agent: `dsh --profile <name>` boots an
 * ordered stack of plugin-bundle patch layers, and DeepSeek ships only `web`
 * (browser UI), `headless` (one-shot) and `base` (no app). The interactive
 * terminal agent Codeman actually drives is a THIRD-PARTY profile the user
 * installs. That is why this module resolves two independent things — a binary
 * AND a profile inventory — and why "available" for the deepseek run mode means
 * both (`isDeepSeekRunnable`, and `resolveDeepSeekLaunchError` in session-routes.ts
 * for the actionable per-half message).
