   *     an interactive trust prompt the session user could just answer "yes" to),
   *     so the clamp must CREATE a config object even when none was sent.

   * above, and one cannot substitute for the other. `privilegedParams` clamps a field on a

   * Dropping (rather than rewriting) is deliberate: the value then falls through to what

   *   - `DSH_HOME` points the launcher at a profile tree whose plugin code runs at BOOT,

   *   - `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` would redirect the server's OWN forwarded `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
   *     to a host of the caller's choosing.
   *
   * Every other CLI's bypass is a command-line flag reachable only through its config
   * object, which is why `privilegedParams` alone is the whole gate for them.

   * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL`). `configContentEnv`: a full config blob
   * carried in one env var (opencode's `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`).
   * `configDir`: a generated config file under an isolated, dir-redirect-env-
   * pointed directory so the user's real CLI config is never touched
   * (codex's `CODEX_HOME`/`config.toml`, pi/omp's `PI_CONFIG_DIR`, grok's
   * `GROK_HOME`/`config.toml`). `unsupported`: no known mechanism
   * (antigravity) — the toolbar entry stays disabled for this CLI.
   *

   * live-tested against a real grok binary, it produced "Not signed in",
   * because those env vars are not grok's real custom-endpoint mechanism at
   * all. The real one is a `[model.<name>]` block in a `config.toml` under
   * `GROK_HOME` (verified against xAI's own docs), same shape as codex/pi/
   * omp — this is why the confidence table in docs/custom-model-endpoints-plan.md exists:
   * "researched" web docs can still be plausible-sounding and wrong.
   *
   * Every env var name this introduces that can redirect a session's
   * traffic MUST also appear in `privilegedEnvKeys` above, exactly like
   * `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` — a non-granted multi-user owner redirecting a
   * session to their own endpoint is a credential-exfiltration path, not
   * just a mischief redirect.
   *
   * `launchModel` is the value the entry's own `model` launch param must carry
   * for the CLI to SELECT the injected provider, as a template where
   * `{modelId}` is the chosen model id. Writing the config file is not enough
   * for pi and omp (`--model custom/<id>`, or the CLI stays on its own default
   * provider and reports "No API key found for the selected model") or for
   * grok (`--model codeman-custom`, the `[model.<name>]` block the config
   * declares). Absent = the config alone selects the model (claude's env vars,
   * opencode's blob, codex's top-level `model` key). Applied by the session's
   * respawn options through the entry's `legacyConfigField`, never by id.
   *
   * `contextLengthVar` (env kind only): the env var a discovered per-model context-window
   * size is written to when known (claude's `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`) — without it,
   * a CLI that assumes a large default window for an unrecognized model name keeps sending
   * full-size prompts against a much smaller local server and eventually overflows its real
   * context (verified: a 33.7K-token system prompt against a 16384-token llama-swap model).
   * Absent when the CLI has no such override, or the value is unknown for this model.
   *
   * `configDirVar` (env kind only): the env var that redirects this session's config/
   * credential directory to an isolated, per-session one (claude's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), so
   * an injected API key never coexists with a stored claude.ai OAuth session in the same
   * directory — the CLI still warns "both claude.ai and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set" when they
   * share a directory even though the API key wins for actual requests. Isolating it trades
   * that cosmetic warning for a documented side effect: a relocated config directory writes
   * transcripts outside `~/.claude/projects`, blinding the response viewer, subagent
   * windows, and Read My Mind for that session (see docs/wiki/Agent-CLIs.md).
   *
   * `apiKeyTrustFile` (env kind only, alongside configDirVar): an isolated config directory
   * has none of a real profile's prior "detected a custom API key, use it?" approvals, so
   * without this the CLI stops and asks interactively on every single launch — with no one
   * at a TTY to answer, that's a hang, not a warning (confirmed live: claude's own default
   * answer, "No", would silently refuse to use the very key this feature just injected).
   * `relPath`/`shape` name the file (claude's `.claude.json`) and its
   * `customApiKeyResponses.approved` field this pre-seeds — the exact field a real answered
   * prompt itself writes to, so this isn't bypassing the check, just answering it the same
   * way a one-off prior approval on a shared profile already would.
   *
   * `skipFirstRunPrompts` (env kind only, alongside apiKeyTrustFile): an isolated config
   * directory is not just missing API-key approvals — it is a brand-new profile as far as
   * the CLI is concerned, so it also replays its ENTIRE first-run sequence on every launch:
   * the theme picker, the security-notes screen, the per-project "trust this folder?"
   * dialog, and (running with a bypass-permissions flag) a one-time warning about it —
   * confirmed live, none of which a real, long-used profile ever shows again. `true`
   * pre-seeds the same state a real profile accumulates from having answered all of that
   * once: `hasCompletedOnboarding` and the launching session's own project entry in the
   * `apiKeyTrustFile` (claude's `.claude.json`), plus `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`
   * in claude's `settings.json` — see `seedFirstRunState`/`seedSkipBypassPermissionsPrompt`
   * in custom-model-injection-apply.ts. Requires `apiKeyTrustFile` to be set too, since it
   * reuses that file.
   *
   * `appendV1Suffix` (env kind only): the raw `endpoint.baseUrl` gets `withV1Suffix()`
   * applied before being written to `baseUrlVar`, instead of being used verbatim.
   * DeepSeek needs this and claude/gemini must NOT get it — a per-CLI asymmetry confirmed
   * by reading each SDK's own request-building source, not assumed: DeepSeek Harness's
   * bundled `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-deepseek` concatenates `${connection.baseURL}/chat/
   * completions` with no `/v1` insertion of its own (its real public API base,
   * `https://api.deepseek.com`, expects the caller's base URL to already carry any
   * needed prefix), while llama-swap/llama.cpp only ever serves the OpenAI-conventional
   * `/v1/chat/completions` — confirmed live: a bare `POST <baseUrl>/chat/completions`
   * 404s, `POST <baseUrl>/v1/chat/completions` succeeds, and the harness's own error
   * message template (`DeepSeek API error (HTTP ${status})`) reproduces the exact
   * `HTTP_404` this feature originally shipped with unexplained. Claude Code's own SDK,
   * by contrast, was already confirmed working end-to-end against the RAW `baseUrl` with
   * no suffix — appending one there would be wrong, not just redundant.
