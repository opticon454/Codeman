/**
 * @fileoverview TerminalTile: one independent live terminal pane bound to one
 * session, with its own xterm instance and its own
 * `/ws/sessions/:id/terminal` WebSocket. The split pane (terminal-split.js)
 * uses one as its second pane ("Pane B"); the tile grid (tile-grid.js,
 * docs/tile-grid-plan.md) uses one per tile, and feeds every capture they
 * fetch through ONE TileLoadQueue (below), because each capture is a
 * synchronous tmux call that blocks the server's event loop.
 *
 * Deliberately plainer than the primary pane (this.terminal/this._ws in
 * terminal-ui.js): no local-echo overlay, no CJK IME textarea, no touch/mobile
 * handlers (a swipe on a touch screen pages nothing), and no keyboard
 * accessory bar. Built for wide screens; see docs/split-pane-sessions-plan.md
 * and docs/tile-grid-plan.md.
 *
 * What it does carry over from the primary pane, through the primary pane's
 * own code aimed at THIS pane (its terminal, its session, never the active
 * one):
 *  - SGR wheel forwarding (_maybeForwardWheelToCli): Claude's fullscreen
 *    renderer scrolls its own transcript on SGR wheel reports, while this
 *    xterm holds only replayed repaint frames, so the wheel goes to the CLI
 *    as reports at the pointer's cell in this pane, through the primary
 *    pane's forwarding gate and its encoding (sgrWheelReports). Shift+wheel
 *    scrolls the local scrollback itself (_maybeScrollLocalOnShift), as the
 *    primary pane does, since xterm turns it into a horizontal no-op.
 *  - Hollow-buffer paging (#555): a CLI that draws in place (opencode on the
 *    alternate screen, Claude's repaint mode) leaves the xterm no scrollback,
 *    so the wheel pages the CLI's own transcript with PageUp/PageDown
 *    (_maybePageCliTranscript) through the primary pane's gates, plus an
 *    overflow-row discount for this pane's capture-before-resize load
 *    (_localRows), and only while the viewport is on the live screen (a
 *    wheel-down from those overflow rows is xterm's, and brings it home).
 *  - The desktop click report: a plain left-click hand-encoded as SGR while
 *    the session's CLI has mouse tracking on (cliMouseTracking), for the modes
 *    whose mouse DECSETs the server strips (_installClickListener), sent
 *    ephemeral, like every mouse report from this pane (_onTerminalData).
 *  - The soft-keyboard controller (terminal-keycode229-recovery.js), one per
 *    pane, on this pane's own textarea and composition helper and sending to
 *    this pane's session (_createKeyCode229Recovery): it forwards an
 *    `insertText` xterm refused, settles a pending textarea edit at the next
 *    keydown ahead of that key (#441: the last character an Android keyboard
 *    commits in the same task as Enter), and replaces xterm's append-only
 *    keyCode-229 diff with an edit-based one (#541: autocorrect on space
 *    duplicated the line). Not a desktop-only concern: the grid and the split
 *    are gated on width alone (SPLIT_PANE_MIN_WIDTH, 1180 CSS px), which a wide
 *    Android tablet, or a large foldable unfolded in landscape, reaches.

   * and it is not held to one slice per animation frame either (that pacing
   * took about a second per 1 MiB, with the grid's load queue waiting behind
