/**
 * @fileoverview Blocking-wait registry backing the agent wait primitives.
 *
 * Codeman's only "tell me when" channel today is SSE, which an agent driving the
 * API from a shell tool cannot practically consume (it would have to hold a
 * streaming connection and parse events inline). This registry is the piece that
 * lets a request *block* until something happens instead, so an orchestrating
 * agent can `curl` and wait. Plan: `docs/agent-control-plan.md`.
 *
 * Two waiter kinds:
 * - **signal waiters** resolve on the first of a requested set of lifecycle
 *   signals (`idle`, `working`, `stop`, `blocked`, `exit`).
 * - **output waiters** resolve when a literal string appears in a session's
 *   ANSI-stripped output.
 *
 * ## What "ANSI-stripped output" means here
 *
 * `normalizeForMatch()` defines it, and it is a superset of `stripAnsi()`: that helper
 * knows three escape families and leaves the rest, which is enough for `ESC ( B` from a
 * stock bash prompt to break `match=tnode:` on a prompt that reads `tnode:`. Everything
 * downstream derives from one call to it, so the carry, the haystack and the snippet
 * window are all the same text. The returned `snippet` is then RENDERED from that window
 * (control bytes removed, blank runs collapsed) and so is not a byte-for-byte quotation
 * of what was matched — see `findMatch`.
 *
 * ## Signal provenance (why `stop` is the good one)
 *
 * `idle` / `working` / `exit` come from `Session`'s own events (heuristic: output
 * stabilization plus prompt detection), so `idle` can flap mid-turn when a spinner
 * pauses. `stop` and `blocked` come from Claude Code hooks (`POST /api/hook-event`)
 * and are definitive. Only `claude` mode installs those hooks, so `stop` and
 * `blocked` never fire for anything else: callers must be rejected up front rather
 * than left to hit the timeout. `hooksAvailableForMode()` keeps that rule in one
 * place, and it is keyed on the MODE rather than on `isExternalCliMode()` because
 * `shell` is not an external CLI yet installs no hooks either.
 *
 * ## Ordering contract for the wiring
 *
 * A session that exits must `notifySignal(id, 'exit')` BEFORE `cancelAll(id)`, so
 * a caller waiting on `exit` gets `signal: 'exit'` rather than `ended: true`.
 *
 * ## Lifetime discipline (24h sessions)
 *
 * Every waiter owns exactly one timer, cleared on resolve, and waiter sets are
 * deleted when they empty. Session teardown must call `cancelAll()` and shutdown
 * `stop()`: timers are deliberately NOT unref'd, because an unref'd timer can let
 * the process exit mid-wait and strand the HTTP response.
 *
 * Two things keep a slot from outliving its caller:
 * - `abortSignal`, so a client that hangs up frees its waiter immediately instead of
 *   holding one for the rest of its timeout. Routes wire it to `req.raw.on('close')`.
 * - the latched stopped flag, so a request that lands in the window between shutdown
 *   starting and the HTTP server actually closing cannot register a fresh waiter that
 *   nothing will ever cancel.
 *
 * This module holds no IO and no `Session` reference, which is what keeps it
 * unit-testable in isolation.

/**
 * The signal a session is *already* emitting, given its status, so a wait can
 * resolve immediately instead of hanging until something changes.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What this CANNOT tell you: whether the session is alive.** It sees only the
 * four-value `SessionStatus` enum, and that enum does not distinguish a finished
 * worker from a dead one. Both PTY `onExit` handlers in `session.ts` (Claude
 * interactive and shell) park the session at `'idle'`, and a PTY exit does not remove
 * the session from the map, so a crashed worker reports `'idle'` indefinitely and this
 * function will answer `'idle'` for it forever. `'stopped'` is set only on a spawn
 * failure and by `stop(killMux:true)` (which deletes the session moments later), so in
 * practice the `'stopped' → 'exit'` arm almost never fires for a session that merely
 * died.
 *
 * Read the return value as "what state is it in", never as "is it still running". A
 * caller that must tell a completed turn from a corpse has to consult liveness itself
 * (`session.pid`, which is null after a PTY exit) and cannot get it from here. The
 * live `exit` signal is still delivered by `notifySignal(id, 'exit')` at the moment
 * the PTY dies; this function is only about the state a LATER caller finds.
 *
 * `stopped` and `error` both map to `exit` because both mean "not running", so a
 * caller that does catch one of them does not block. `blocked` is deliberately
 * underivable here, it exists only as a hook event until it becomes a real
 * `SessionStatus` (see the deferred Part 3 in the plan).

/**
 * Escape sequences `stripAnsi` leaves behind, removed so the text this module MATCHES
 * against is what the pane visually shows.
 *
 * `ANSI_ESCAPE_PATTERN_FULL` covers three families — `ESC [ … letter`,
 * `ESC ] … (BEL|ST)`, and `ESC =` / `ESC >` — and nothing else. The gap is not
 * theoretical: a stock bash prompt emits `arkon@tnode\x1b(B\x1b[m:`, the CSI is removed
 * and the charset-select `ESC ( B` is not, so `match=tnode:` **fails on a prompt that
 * plainly reads `tnode:`** while `match=(B` succeeds. That is the single most likely
 * thing an orchestrating agent tries, and the failure is silent (a full-length timeout).
 *
 * Two branches, in order:
 * - `ESC P|X|^|_ … (BEL|ST)` — DCS / SOS / PM / APC string sequences. The terminator is
 *   REQUIRED, exactly as `stripAnsi`'s OSC branch requires one: matching an unterminated
 *   string type with a greedy run would delete every byte after it to the end of the
 *   window, which is real output an agent is waiting for.
 * - `ESC <0x20-0x2f>* <0x30-0x7e>` — the ECMA-48 escape-sequence grammar (zero or more
 *   intermediate bytes then a final byte). This is what covers `ESC ( B`, `ESC ) 0`,
 *   `ESC c`, `ESC 7` / `ESC 8`, `ESC # 8` and a stray `ESC \`.
 *
 * Linear-time by the same argument that holds for `stripAnsi`: every starred class is
 * disjoint from what follows it, and `ESC` is excluded from all of them, so two
 * candidate runs can never overlap and there is no backtracking to exploit.
 *
 * ⚠️ This duplicates ANSI knowledge that would be better held once in
 * `src/utils/regex-patterns.ts`. It lives here deliberately: `stripAnsi` has many
 * consumers (respawn and usage-limit pattern matching, the terminal buffer, search) and
 * widening it changes all of them at once, which is not a change to make as a side
 * effect of fixing this endpoint. See the follow-up note in
 * `tmp/agent-wait-review/report-fix-registry.md`.

 *
 * - **Matched**: `hay`, which is `normalizeForMatch()` output — ANSI-stripped and
 *   residue-stripped, with nothing else touched. `matched` is decided against exactly

 * - **Returned**: a bounded window of that same text, then RENDERED for a human or an

 *
 * So the snippet is a rendering of the matched window, not a quotation of it. The
 * remaining differences cannot change whether a printable needle matched, but they are
 * real: a needle containing `\n\n` or a raw control byte is matchable and would not
 * appear verbatim in the snippet.
 *
 * Blank runs are collapsed for READABILITY ONLY. A real pane pads with dozens of `\r\n`
 * between the prompt and the match, which would otherwise fill the whole context window
 * with nothing and make the snippet useless to the agent reading it.
 *
 * Control bytes are dropped because, unlike `GET .../terminal`, this field is documented
 * as stripped and its consumer is an agent piping it through `jq` into its OWN terminal

 * the orchestrator's display. Whitespace is preserved; every other C0/C1 control and DEL
